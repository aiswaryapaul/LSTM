# LSTM
LSTM Text Generation using TensorFlow/Keras
📘 Project Overview

This project implements an LSTM-based text generation model built from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras. It demonstrates how Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, can learn sequential dependencies and generate coherent text.

📊 Key Steps

Data Loading & Preprocessing:
Loaded State of the Union speech dataset and prepared it for modeling.

Tokenization & N-Gram Sequence Creation:
Converted text into integer sequences and created input-output pairs for next-word prediction.

Padding:
Standardized input sequence lengths using zero-padding.

Model Architecture:

Embedding layer for word representation

LSTM layer with 150 units

Dense output layer with softmax activation

Training:
Trained on categorical cross-entropy loss with the Adam optimizer for 10 epochs.

Text Generation (Next Word Prediction):
Given a seed text, the model predicts the next likely words sequentially.
